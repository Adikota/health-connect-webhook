# Health Connect to Webhook

An Android app that forwards health data from Google Fit, Samsung Health, Fitbit,
and other apps to your webhooks or local tools via Health Connect.

## How it works

1. Your health apps sync to **Health Connect**, which aggregates them into one API.
2. **HC Webhook** reads that data on an interval, on a schedule, or on demand.
3. It `POST`s the data to your webhook URLs (JSON or Protobuf/gRPC) and can serve
   realtime JSON over your local network.
4. Your services, agents, or automation tools receive it.
