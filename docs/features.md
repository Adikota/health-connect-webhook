  intent for Tasker / MacroDroid. See [Automation](#automation).
- **Webhook logs** — timestamps, status codes, and response bodies for every request.
- **Permission management** — granular Health Connect permission handling.
- **Settings backup** — export/import webhook configs, data type selections, and
  sync schedule.

- **In-app feedback** — submit bugs and ideas from the About screen; stored locally
  and synced to [FeedbackJar](https://hc-webhook.feedbackjar.com/).

## Automation

Three ways to start a sync without opening the app. They all run a normal sync to
your configured webhooks, and they share a one-minute limit: a second trigger within
a minute of the last accepted one is ignored (the tile says "Try again in a minute").

- **Widget** — "Sync status" on the home screen: last sync time and summary, a sync
  button, and a tap to open the app. It updates after every sync.
- **Quick Settings tile** — "Sync health data". Add it by editing the Quick Settings
  panel. On Android 10+ it shows the last sync time.
- **Broadcast intent** — for Tasker, MacroDroid or a computer:
  - Tasker: **System → Send Intent**, Action `com.hcwebhook.app.ACTION_SYNC`,
    Package `com.hcwebhook.app`, Target **Broadcast Receiver**.
  - MacroDroid: **Send Intent** with the same action and package, target **Broadcast**.
  - adb: `adb shell am broadcast -a com.hcwebhook.app.ACTION_SYNC -p com.hcwebhook.app`

  The package is required: Android does not deliver the broadcast without it. The
  intent carries no settings; it only starts a sync.

## Supported health apps

Health Connect aggregates data from apps like Google Fit, Samsung Health, Fitbit,
MyFitnessPal, Strava, Nike Run Club, Withings, Garmin Connect, Polar, Oura, and
any other app that syncs to Health Connect. You don't need all of them — just make
sure the apps you use sync to Health Connect.

## Supported languages

(Simplified), Japanese, Korean, Italian. Override from the **About** screen.
